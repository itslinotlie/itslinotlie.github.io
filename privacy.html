          <p style="text-align: left;">
            Your privacy is important. Afterall, this app would be nothing without its users. 
            We wish to be as transparent as possible with how your data is used when you use 
            Sigma as your Spreadsheet Add-on.

            <h3><b>What Information is Collected?</b></h3>
            <p>
                Nothing. The script runs locally on the user’s machine and no information is ever saved throughout this process.
                The information on the Spreadsheet is parsed through the script and regurgitated onto a Google Form. There is 
                no third-party that collects data during this process or sees what is on your Form. <br>
    
                Although some of the scopes seem questionable (i.e. “See, edit, create, and delete all of your 
                Google Drive files”), this is because there are no lower permission alternatives. The option for the developer is
                essentially either "do you want a Google Form" or "nothing works." Elaborating on the given example, the script only
                places the Google Forms in a specified folder if told specifically. For the technically savvy people, you will find that 
                the only times the script ever references a "delete-something" method is when the script needs to delete extra rows/columns
                when initializing the Speadsheet. <br><br>

                tldr; the Spreadsheet only accesses the data given and nothing is collected during this process
            </p> <br>
    <!-- 
      The privacy policy clearly describes the way your application accesses, uses, stores, or shares Google user data.
     -->
            <h3><b>How is the data used?</b></h3>
            <p>
                Information on the Spreadsheet is used to create Google Forms. By parsing the information on the Google Sheets,
                the script is able to create the desired Google Form. As mentioned before, there is no keeping of user data throughout this process.
                This means that the data is only used for creating Google Forms and nothing else. <br><br>

                tldr; the Spreadsheet can only use the given information because nothing is stored through the script
            </p> <br>
    
            <h3><b>What information is shared?</b></h3>
            <p>
                Your data is safe from being shared, as nothing is ever collected with the add-on. <br><br>

                tldr; data is not stored, which means no information can be shared
            </p> <br>
