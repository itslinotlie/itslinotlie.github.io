          <p style="text-align: left;">
            Your privacy is important. Afterall, this app would be nothing without its users. 
            We wish to be as transparent as possible with how your data is used when you utilize 
            Sigma as your Spreadsheet Add-on.

            <h3><b>What Information is collected</b></h3>
            <p>
                Nothing. The script runs locally on the user’s machine and no information is ever saved throughout the process.
                The information on the Spreadsheet is parsed through the script and is regurgitated onto a Google Form. There is 
                no third-party that collects data during this process. <br>
    
                Although some of the scopes may seem to indicate otherwise (i.e. “See, edit, create, and delete all of your 
                Google Drive files”), this is because there are no lower permission alternatives. Following the given example, the 
                script only “sees” the Google Drive image URLs that are provided in the Spreadsheet to place the image onto the "created" Google Form.
                For the technically savvy people, you will see that the only times that the script ever references "delete"-something is to delete extra 
                rows/columns when initializing the Spreadsheet. 

                tldr; the Spreadsheet only accesses the data given, even though it may not seam like so sometimes
            </p> <br>
    <!-- 
      The privacy policy clearly describes the way your application accesses, uses, stores, or shares Google user data.

            <h3><b>How is the data used?</b></h3>
            <p>
                Information on the Spreadsheet is used to create Google Forms. By parsing the information on the Google Sheets,
                the script is able to create the desired Google Form. As mentioned before, there is no keeping of user data throughout this process.
                Everything runs locally and nothing is saved.

                tldr; the Spreadsheet only uses given information and nothing is stored through the script
            </p> <br>
    
            <h3><b>What information is shared?</b></h3>
            <p>
                Your data is safe from being shared, as nothing is ever collected with the add-on.

                tldr; no data is being stored
            </p> <br>
