          <p style="text-align: left;">
            I'm not fond of long legal documents, but this page is required. Essentially, the Terms of
            Service of Sigma can boil down to:<br>
            &emsp;- You may not create derivatives of the script without our consent.<br>
            &emsp;- If the use of Sigma is not allowed in your organization, donâ€™t use it.<br>
            &emsp;- We are not responsible for the content you create with the script.<br>
            &emsp;- We may change these terms at any time.<br>
            That said, it is still recommended you read the full Terms of Service, available below.
          </p>

        <div style="text-align: left;">

          <h3><b>Use License</b></h3>
          <p>
