          <p style="text-align: left;">
            Your privacy is important. Afterall, this app would be nothing without its users. 
            We wish to be as transparent as possible with how your data is used when you utilize 
            Sigma as your Spreadsheet Add-on.
          </p>

        <div style="text-align: left;">
            <h3><b>What Information is collected</b></h3>
            <p>
                Nothing. The script runs locally on the user’s machine and no information is ever saved throughout the process.
                The information that is parsed through the Spreadsheet is directly transferred onto the Form with no third-party 
                collecting the data. <br>
    
                Although some of the scopes may seem to indicate otherwise (i.e. “See, edit, create, and delete all of your 
                Google Drive files”), this is because there are no lower permission alternatives. From the given example, the 
                script only “sees” the Google Drive image URLs provided to conveniently place the images on the Form. 
    
            </p> <br>
    
            <h3><b>How is your data used?</b></h3>
            <p>
                The information you have on your Spreadsheet and the URLs you provide get parsed through the script, 
                which allows you to conveniently create your Forms. As mentioned before, no information is kept during 
                this process as everything runs locally. 
            </p> <br>
    
            <h3><b>What information is shared?</b></h3>
            <p>
                Your data is safe from being shared, as nothing is ever collected with the add-on.
            </p> <br>
    
            <h3><b>Contact Us</b></h3>
