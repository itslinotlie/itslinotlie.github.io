            <h1>Welcome to Sigma’s Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>
                Your privacy is important to us. Afterall, this app would be nothing without its users. 
                We wish to be as transparent as possible with how your data is used when you utilize 
                Sigma as your Spreadsheet Add-on.
            </p> <br>

            <h3>What Information is collectedÉ</h3>
            <p>
                Nothing. The script runs locally on the user’s machine and no information is ever saved throughout the process.
                The information that is parsed through the Spreadsheet is directly transferred onto the Form with no third-party 
                collecting the data. <br>

                Although some of the scopes may seem to indicate otherwise (i.e. “See, edit, create, and delete all of your 
                Google Drive files”), this is because there are no lower permission alternatives. From the given example, the 
                script only “sees” the Google Drive image URLs provided to conveniently place the images on the Form. 

            </p> <br>

            <h3>How is your data used?</h3>
            <p>
                The information you have on your Spreadsheet and the URLs you provide get parsed through the script, 
                which allows you to conveniently create your Forms. As mentioned before, no information is kept during 
                this process as everything runs locally. 
            </p> <br>

            <h3>What information is shared?</h3>
            <p>
                Your data is safe from being shared, as nothing is ever collected with the add-on.
            </p> <br>
