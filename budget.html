            <h1>Welcome to Sigma’s Terms of Service</h1>
            <p>
                We’re not fond of long legal documents, but we have to have this page. Essentially, the Terms of Service of Sigma can boil down to:<br>
                &emsp;- You may not create derivatives of the script without our consent.<br>
                &emsp;- If the use of Sigma is not allowed in your organization, don’t use it.<br>
                &emsp;- We are not responsible for the content you create with the script.<br>
                &emsp;- We may change these terms at any time.<br>
                That said, we still recommend you read the full Terms of Service, available below.
            </p> <br>
